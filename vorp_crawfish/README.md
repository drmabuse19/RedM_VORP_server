# Notes
- You may encounter some Crawfish Hole locations which aren't yet included in the config; if you do, please feel free to submit them to github for addition so that everyone can enjoy the benefits.
- Crawfish Hole locations are not marked on the map or minimap; they may be difficult to find if you don't know what you're looking for... also, be wary of alligators when searching!
