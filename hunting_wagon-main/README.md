# hunterwagon
Store animals/furs in a wagon for hunting.

You can edit the wagons able to be used in the client side file under the local cart area.
A list of vehicles can be obtained from https://github.com/femga/rdr3_discoveries/tree/master/vehicles

Wagons are touchy with the prompt, so keep walking around the wagon until it displays.<br>
You also have to hold the prompt for a bit longer for it to work.<br>
You will know when it works as it will do a FadeOut effect.

Happy Hunting<br>
