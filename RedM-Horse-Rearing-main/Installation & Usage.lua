# Horse Rearing

This is a very *simple* script that allows the player to do the trick from RDO, known as "Rearing".

#Installation

Drag "HorseRearing" to your resources folder and add "ensure HorseRearing" to your server.cfg
Restart the server, 

or simply use the F8 Console ingame and do commands "refresh" and "start HorseRearing" to start it ingame. 
*REMINDER, THIS ONLY STARTS IT FOR THAT SESSION. ADD IT TO YOUR SERVER.CFG TO ENSURE IT STARTS UP BY ITSELF ON SERVER START.

After install, you're good to go.

#Usage

The script is very simple, it has two steps.

Get on a horse, and simply type "/rear" into the chatbox and watch your horse do the Rearing trick.

If you do the command and you are not on a horse, it will tell you in the F8 console that you are not mounted on a horse. 
If this tells you that you are not mounted, but you are, let me know which horse ped it was and i will fix it.
