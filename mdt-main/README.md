## How to Install?

1. Make sure to rename the folder to mdt and then ensure mdt on your resources list. Also disable any other mdt script you are using.
2. Run the user_mdt SQL in your database.
3. Inside config.lua you will be able to change the jobs required and command to use the mdt (default is police, marshal, sheriff, and ranger and more can be added now).
4. To bring up the mdt use /aa in chat (this can be changed in config) and itll bring up the mdt with an animation as if you were pulling out a notebook or notepad.
