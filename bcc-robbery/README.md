# How it works!
- Enter the command you set in the config to enable robberies. Then when you are near a valid robbery location shoot your gun to start it!
- Once you have started a robbery you will need to wait out the timer, and defend yourself from enemy npcs if you enabled them.
- Once the timer has ran out you can begin lockpicking the loot boxes to gain rewards!
- If you enabled police alerts you will want to make haste as the cops will be on thier way!

# Future Plans
- Restrict robberies to only be able to start if a certain amount of police are online
- Only spawn the npcs if no police are online
