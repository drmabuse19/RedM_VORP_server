# Vorp Utils 

> A Vorp Utility Script that allows developers to easily interact with RedM Natives and VorpCore in a Vorp standardized way. The goal of this is to make it easier to use some of the more complicated, or heavily lined natives.

## How to install
* Download the lastest version of VORP utils
* Copy and paste ```vorp_utils``` folder to ```resources/vorp_utils```
* Add ```ensure vorp_utils``` to your ```resource.cfg``` file
* To change the language go to ```resources/vorp_inventory/Config``` and change the default language, also you will have to edit the html file to change the text on the inventory menu

## Features
1. Map Blips
2. UI Prompts
3. Pedestrian Spawning/Management
4. Object Spawning/Management (COMING SOON)
5. We are always open to more ideas!
