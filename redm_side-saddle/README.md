# RedM Side Saddle Riding üêé üíÖ

A script to allow for side saddle riding in RedM  ‚Äì where old-world charm meets the modern frontier.



## Hat Tip üé©

 A monumental nod to [@Kibook](https://github.com/kibook). 
 I refined their original script for a smoother RedM experience.

## Features

- Activate side saddle mode anytime using the /sidesaddle command, even if not on a horse, to seamlessly mount your character in the side saddle position. *To revert back to normal riding position, use the command again.*
- Side saddle is exclusively available for the left position due to skeletal animation limitations, eliminating the right position option.
- Drawing weapons, be it firearms or others, will automatically shift the player to a standard riding stance, ensuring no animation overlaps involving the arms, head, or torso.
- To avoid uncontrolled dismounts, the side saddle dismount is only permissible during slow rides.
- For an uninterrupted visual experience, the player will assume a raised position during fast rides to prevent any overlap with the horse's model.
- Works for male and female peds.
