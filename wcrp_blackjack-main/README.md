Update Version of Blackjack


Add chips, and chips 2 to Database, way it works is you go behind the saloon desk and you will see a war menu prompt where you can buy chips, In my server I had it set as Gambling chips, when you win it will convert chips to chips2 which I named Winning Chips. This is to prevent sell back abuse how it orginally used to be.


 Be sure to change the '@warmenu/warmenu.lua' in fxmanifest to where your war menu is located or add the file into the folder, i use war menu externally so just change location path to where yours is located
