# Description
It does what the title says it does! Play the piano<br>
and become the entertainer of the saloons. When you<br>
walk up to the piano, you can use space to start<br>
playing. If you want to stop, you simply hit F.<br>
If you couldn't in real life, now you can in RedM!

---
# Features
- Customizable Config.
- Ability to add or remove pianos.

---
# Disclaimer
I have added 6 pianos to the script, these are the<br>
most used saloon places. If you want to add more<br>
pianos on the list, then keep in mind that now all<br>
pianos work! This has to do with the seat in front<br>
of it. Small round seats can be used, while chairs<br>
can't. This is also the final version! It could be<br>
that I change a little here and there, but don't<br>
expect much more made in this script. I would not<br>
know what to put extra in it. If you have any ideas<br>
for a future update, feel free to contact me.
